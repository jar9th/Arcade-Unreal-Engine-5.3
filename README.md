This is a skill arcade I made in unreal engine 5.3 using blueprints. I'm still very new to unreal engine and this was just a simple project.
All but one arcade machines use 'E' input to play when you are standing in the play box for the machine.

With my pc when the frames are getting below 58-50 fps the physics start to not work so well.

Most of the assets used was made by me in blender or unreal engine. The sounds, music, space ship come from open game art.org.
Flappy chicken assets come from Unreal University youtube tutorial. And the remake of out run theme song was made by me.
